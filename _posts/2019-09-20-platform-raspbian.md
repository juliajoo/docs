# Raspbian 

Raspbian is a linux based computer operating system for the Raspberry Pi. 


## Running Code on Startup 
A useful workflow for the pi, is to run some particular code always on startup.
A good way of doing that is by using the systemd interface.  You can set up this by 
**creating a service**, which starts with a service script.
Start by creating a service script in your Pi's terminal
(replace MY_EXAMPLE with an appropriate name):

``` bash
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/MY_EXAMPLE.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/MY_EXAMPLE.service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/MY_EXAMPLE.service

```

Now you can configure your service script (you can find more details [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files)):
```bash
[Unit]
Description=My description 
After=multi-user.target 
 
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 ABSOLUTE_PATH/YOUR_SCRIPT.py
 
StandardOutput=syslog 
StandardError=syslog 
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
User=root
Group=root 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Notes:
* After details if the service needs to wait for anything before
running, you can put other "events" in "After"
* Note you must always give the absolute path, 
You can get this by running the "pwd"
in your command line in the file's location, 
and appending the "/FILE_NAME" to the response
if anything goes wrong,
* The restart part ensures your service always restarts on any problem.

Now you can attempt to start the service with the command:
```bash
# Start service
sudo systemctl start MY_EXAMPLE.service

```

Use status to make sure the service started with no hiccups

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status MY_EXAMPLE.service
```

Afterwards stop it, make sure it was stopped properly, and then
configure the service to start automatically at boot:

```bash
# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop MY_EXAMPLE.service

# configure automatic start
sudo systemctl enable MY_EXAMPLE.service
```
